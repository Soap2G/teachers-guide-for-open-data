# The Standard Model

The Standard Model (SM) is the foundational theory describing fundamental particles and their interactions, excluding gravity. It classifies all known elementary particles and explains how they interact through three of the four fundamental forces.

## Fermions: Building Blocks of Matter

Fermions are particles with half-integer spin (spin-½) and constitute the matter in the universe. They are divided into two categories:

- **Quarks**: Particles that carry fractional electric charges and participate in all fundamental forces, including the strong force. Quarks combine to form hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. There are six flavors:
  - Up (u) and Down (d)
  - Charm (c) and Strange (s)
  - Top (t) and Bottom (b)
  
- **Leptons**: Particles that do not participate in the strong force. The lepton family includes:
  - Electron (e), Muon (μ), and Tau (τ)
  - Their corresponding neutrinos (νₑ, ν_μ, ν_τ), which are neutral and interact primarily via the weak force

## Bosons: Force Carriers

Bosons are particles with integer spin and mediate the fundamental forces:

- **Photon (γ)**: Carrier of the electromagnetic force, massless and chargeless.
- **W and Z Bosons**: Mediators of the weak force, responsible for processes like beta decay. W bosons are charged (W⁺, W⁻), and the Z boson is neutral.
- **Gluons (g)**: Carriers of the strong force, binding quarks within hadrons. They carry the color charge.
- **Higgs Boson (H)**: A scalar particle (spin-0) arising from the Higgs field, which imparts mass to other particles through the Higgs mechanism.

## Fundamental Interactions

The Standard Model describes three fundamental forces through gauge theories based on specific symmetries:

- **Electromagnetic Force**: Described by U(1) symmetry, mediated by photons, affecting electrically charged particles.
- **Weak Nuclear Force**: Described by SU(2) symmetry, mediated by W and Z bosons, responsible for radioactive decay and neutrino interactions.
- **Strong Nuclear Force**: Described by SU(3) symmetry, mediated by gluons, binding quarks together within protons and neutrons.

The **electroweak theory** unifies the electromagnetic and weak forces under the combined gauge group SU(2)×U(1).

## Higgs Boson and the Higgs Mechanism

The Higgs mechanism introduces the Higgs field, a scalar field with a non-zero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks electroweak symmetry. This process gives mass to the W and Z bosons and fermions. The Higgs boson is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field.

### Production of the Higgs Boson at the LHC

At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the Higgs boson is primarily produced through:

- **Gluon Fusion (ggF)**: Two gluons fuse via a top-quark loop to produce a Higgs boson.
- **Vector Boson Fusion (VBF)**: Involves the fusion of two vector bosons emitted by quarks.
- **Associated Production**: The Higgs boson is produced alongside a W or Z boson (VH) or a pair of top quarks (tt̄H).

These processes have been extensively studied and are essential for understanding the properties of the Higgs boson.

## Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)

While the Standard Model successfully explains many experimental results, it does not account for several observed phenomena, indicating the need for new physics:

- **Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry**: The universe contains more matter than antimatter, a disparity not fully explained by the SM.
- **Neutrino Masses**: Neutrinos have mass, but the SM predicts them to be massless.
- **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**: These constitute most of the universe's mass-energy content but are not included in the SM.
- **Quantum Gravity**: The SM does not incorporate gravity at the quantum level.
- **Hierarchy Problem**: Questions why the Higgs boson mass is much lighter than the Planck scale.
- **Strong CP Problem**: The lack of observed CP violation in strong interactions.

### Searches for New Physics

Experimental efforts at the LHC and other facilities aim to detect signs of physics beyond the Standard Model. These include:

- **Direct Searches**: Looking for new particles predicted by theories like supersymmetry or extra dimensions.
- **Precision Measurements**: Detecting deviations from SM predictions in particle interactions.
- **Studying Rare Processes**: Observing processes that are highly suppressed in the SM but could be enhanced by new physics.
